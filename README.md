# parcel_seggeration_pincode_OCR
1. Introduction:
This project focuses on converting parcel images into digital text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. The primary objective is to extract relevant information, such as addresses and PIN codes, from parcel images to facilitate e-commerce logistics and address identification processes.

2. Methodology:
The project employs several key steps to achieve the desired outcome:

    Image Preprocessing: Parcel images are preprocessed using techniques such as edge detection and contrast enhancement to improve the clarity and quality of the images.
    Container Detection: Canva edge detection algorithms are utilized to identify and isolate individual parcels or containers within the image.
    Text Extraction: Text extraction techniques are applied to extract textual information from the identified containers. This involves utilizing OCR algorithms to recognize and convert the printed text within the containers into digital format.
    PIN Code Extraction: Once the text is extracted, specific information such as PIN codes is identified and extracted from the text data. PIN codes play a crucial role in address identification for e-commerce logistics and delivery purposes.

3. Implementation:
The project is implemented using programming languages such as Python, along with libraries and frameworks including OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, and Canva for image processing and text extraction tasks. The workflow is divided into modular components, each responsible for a specific task, such as image preprocessing, container detection, text extraction, and PIN code extraction.

4. Usage:
To utilize the system, users can input parcel images into the application, which then undergoes the aforementioned steps of image preprocessing, container detection, text extraction, and PIN code extraction. The extracted PIN codes can be used for address identification and e-commerce logistics management.

5. Future Enhancements:
Future enhancements to the project may include refining the image preprocessing techniques for improved accuracy, optimizing the container detection algorithms for better parcel identification, and integrating additional OCR libraries or techniques to handle different types of text and languages more effectively.
